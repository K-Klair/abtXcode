Question:
The function fopen(FILE *fp) in XCode it's not working, I put the text file in the root directory, but not work, it's weird because, executing from terminal works fine, but executing from IDE not.

The sintax that I use it's this:

FILE *fp=fopen("name.txt", "r");
if(fp==NULL)
{
    printf("the text file can't be opened");
    exit(0);
}
else
    return fp;

And always return NULL.


Answer:
well what's the working directory when run via xcode?
by default IIRC it isnt set and that might be the difference between IDE and terminal.

-- set the working dir:

go to: product > scheme > edit scheme...

there go to:
options tab and choose a working directory
